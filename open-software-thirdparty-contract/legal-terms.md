# Overview

This document spells out terms under which _Developer_ will develop open software for _Blockchain Commons_.

# Work Order

These terms apply to work done under any **Work Order** that references these terms.  Each _Work Order_, together with these terms, makes up an agreement between _Blockchain Commons_ and _Developer_.

# Developer's Obligations

## Send a W-9

Before beginning any work, _Developer_ agrees to send _Blockchain Commons_ a complete United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8BEN.

## Do the Work

Beginning on receipt of first payment, _Developer_ agrees to complete all milestones on the _Work Order_ in a timely and professional manner by contributing source code and other written work to the repositories on the _Work Order_.  Work will only count as **Contributions** under this agreement when they are:

- stored in Git commits

- signed according to [Sign Every Commit](#sign-every-commit)

- either:

  - pushed to the main development branch of the relevant repository

  - submitted to that repository as pull requests, e-mail-formatted patches, or similar invitations to incorporate into the main development branch

## Stick to the Repositories

_Developer_ agrees to work on the repositories on the _Work Order_ only, and not to count hours working on any other projects or repositories without prior, written approval from _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative.

## Sign Every Commit

_Developer_ agrees to sign Git commits for all _Contributions_ with a single keypair so that each commit can be verified using Git's built-in verify-commit subcommand.

## Leave Time for Approval

_Developer_ agrees to coordinate with _Blockchain Commons_ to ensure that work is delivered with sufficient time left for _Blockchain Commons_ to clarify and approve completion of milestones before the end date on the _Work Order_.  _Developer_ agrees to work on milestones in a logical order that enables _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative to review and approve milestones in sequence, one at a time.

## Spend Spare Hours on the Repositories

If _Developer_ completes all milestones with hours to spare, _Developer_ agrees to use remaining hours to make general or other improvements to the repositories on the _Work Order_.

## Track Time

_Developer_ agrees to track time spent working on milestones in fairly rounded, quarter-hour increments.

## Send Weekly Reports

_Developer_ agrees to send _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative a report with all the following information within two business days after the end of each workweek:

- a summary of work done during the week

- requests for approval of any milestones

- the number of hours worked so far

- the number of hours remaining

## Send Bills

_Developer_ agrees to bill _Blockchain Commons_ for each payment due under the agreement according to _Blockchain Commons_' billing instructions on the _Work Order_.

## Cover General Expenses

_Developer_ agrees to pay for all equipment, licenses, and services needed to develop open software, generally. For example, _Developer_ agrees to provide their own computer, operating system, development environment, and Internet access.

## Return Loaned Equipment

After work is done under the agreement, and at any time on _Blockchain Commons_' request, _Developer_ agrees to promptly return any equipment _Blockchain Commons_ loaned for work under this agreement.

## Manage Subcontractors

If the _Work Order_ allows _Developer_ to use subcontractors:

- _Developer_ agrees to use only subcontractors that have all the expertise needed to do the work efficiently.

- If _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative objects to a particular subcontractor, _Developer_ agrees to stop using that subcontractor to do work under the agreement.

- _Developer_ agrees to sign a contract with each subcontractor requiring them to abide by the terms of this agreement, assign _Intellectual Property Rights_ to _Developer_, and to abide by any nondisclosure agreement between _Developer_ and _Blockchain Commons_.

- _Developer_ agrees to send _Blockchain Commons_ a copy of any contract with a subcontractor promptly on request.

## Appoint Replacement Technical Representatives

_Developer_ agrees to appoint a replacement technical representative, preapproved by _Blockchain Commons_, if the current one leaves or becomes unavailable.

# Blockchain Commons' Obligations

## Pay Developer's Fee

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay _Developer_ the fee on the schedule on the _Work Order_, if any, and otherwise on this schedule:

- one third of the fee on entering into this agreement

- one third of the fee after _Developer_'s first weekly report that _Developer_ has worked half the hours on the _Work Order_

- one third of the fee  after all milestones are met

## Follow Payment Instructions

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to make all payments to _Developer_ under this agreement denominated in the currency and according to the payment instructions agreed on the _Work Order_.  _Blockchain Commons_ will not increase or decrease payments under this agreement according to, or to offset, changes in the market price of the denominating currency.

## Pay on Time

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay all correctly billed amounts on each bill within seven calendar days of receipt.  If _Blockchain Commons_ does not pay a bill on time, _Developer_ can notify _Blockchain Commons_ and stop work until all overdue bills are paid.  Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines for as long as work stops.

## Cover Extraordinary Expenses

If milestones require extraordinary equipment, licenses, services or other major expenses, then _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to cover the costs to the _Developer_ that _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative preapproves in writing. For example, _Blockchain Commons_ may approve the costs of proprietary software licenses, testing hardware, and specific online services that milestones requires _Developer_ to use. If _Blockchain Commons_ requires _Developer_ to use and return specific equipment, _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay the costs of packaging and shipping, both ways. If _Blockchain Commons_ cannot pay an approved extraordinary expense directly, _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to advance _Developer_ the cost.

## Clarify Milestones

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to respond promptly to _Developer_ requests to clarify milestones.

## Approve Milestones

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to respond promptly to _Developer_ requests to review _Developer_'s work and either confirm that milestones have been completed or clarify what work still needs to be done.

# Intellectual Property

## Purposes of Intellectual Property Terms

[Intellectual Property](#intellectual-property) assigns ownership of intellectual property in _Developer_'s _Contributions_.  That way:

- _Blockchain Commons_ can choose the license for the work, and update that license over time.

- _Blockchain Commons_ can enforce the terms of the licenses it chooses.

- _Blockchain Commons_ can be sure that it actually has the legal rights needed to license and enforce.

## Intellectual Property Definitions

- **New Intellectual Property** means all _Intellectual Property Rights_ in _Developer's_ _Contributions_.

- **Intellectual Property Rights** means copyrights, mask work rights, moral rights, patent rights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress rights, database rights, and rights in any registrations or applications for _Intellectual Property Rights_.

- **Dependencies** means all works that _Developer_'s _Contributions_ explicitly incorporate, depend on, install, configure, invoke, or link to, directly or indirectly.

## Dependencies

_Developer_ agrees to ensure their _Contributions_ under this agreement have only the following kinds of _Dependencies_:

- _Dependencies_ that _Developer_ has the legal right to assign to _Blockchain Commons_ under [Developer Assigns Intellectual Property](#developer-assigns-intellectual-property)

- Permissively licensed software made available to the public on the terms of form licenses that Blue Oak Council rated "Bronze" or better on the start date on the _Work Order_

- _Dependencies_ that _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative specifically preapproves in writing, by name and version, for a specific use case

## Determining Dependencies' Licenses

_Developer_ may rely on LICENSE, COPYING, and similar files, as well as other copyright notices, header comments, or standardized software package metadata, to determine whether _Dependencies_ meet the requirements of [Dependencies](#dependencies).

## Developer Assigns Intellectual Property

_Developer_ assigns all _New Intellectual Property_ to _Blockchain Commons_. Among the rights assigned are:

- ownership of _New Intellectual Property_

- all rights to make legal claims for infringement of _New Intellectual Property_

- all rights to seek legal remedies for infringement of _New Intellectual Property_, such as money damages, injunctions, and other "equitable remedies", as well as any other compensation, benefits, or procedural privileges a court might award

- all other rights _Developer_ has in _New Intellectual Property_

## Further Steps

_Developer_ will do everything necessary to paper assignments in [Developer Assigns Intellectual Property](#contractor-assigns-intellectual-property), make them legally effective, and help _Blockchain Commons_ enforce the rights assigned. _Blockchain Commons_ will notify _Developer_ by e-mail of any further steps required, provide all necessary documentation, and reimburse _Developer_ for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

## Blockchain Commons Can Act on Developer's Behalf

### What Blockchain Commons Can Do

_Blockchain Commons_ can take action under [Further Steps](#further-steps) on _Developer_'s behalf if _Blockchain Commons_ can't find _Developer_, if _Developer_ isn't capable of doing so, or if _Developer_ refuses to do so.

### Legal Intent

In legal terms of art, _Blockchain Commons_ and _Developer_ intend [What Blockchain Commons Can Do](#what-blockchain-commons-can-do) to appoint _Blockchain Commons_ as _Developer_'s "attorney in fact with full right of substitution" to act on _Developer_'s behalf under [Further Steps](#further-steps).

## Other Intellectual Property

_Developer_ licenses _Blockchain Commons_ to do everything that would otherwise infringe _Intellectual Property Rights_ that _Developer_ can license, other than _New Intellectual Property_, that _Developer_'s _Contributions_ use or build on. The license continues forever, cannot be revoked, imposes no royalty or other charge, and allows _Blockchain Commons_ to sublicense.

# Working Relationship

## Independence

_Developer_ will decide when, where, and how to work under this agreement, with the discretion of an independent contractor. _Developer_ will not have any power to enter agreements or take other legal action on _Blockchain Commons_' behalf.

## Personnel

If the _Work Order_ allows, _Developer_ can use employee and contractor personnel to do any work under this agreement. Those personnel will be employees and contractors of _Developer_, not _Blockchain Commons_.

## No Benefits

Neither _Developer_ nor any _Developer_ personnel will receive any employee benefits from _Blockchain Commons_.

## Compliance

Both sides will do their respective parts for tax, labor, employment, and immigration law compliance, consistent with their independent-contractor relationship under this agreement.

## Compliance Indemnity

_Developer_ will pay any losses that _Blockchain Commons_ pays or becomes legally responsible to pay, including expenses of defending against any legal claim, related to _Developer_'s failure under [Compliance](#compliance) for _Developer_ or any _Developer_ personnel. _Blockchain Commons_ will promptly notify _Developer_ by e-mail whenever it anticipates possible losses that _Developer_ might have to pay. If _Blockchain Commons_ fails to notify _Developer_ promptly, _Developer_ will not pay _Blockchain Commons_ losses that _Developer_ could have reduced or defended against if _Blockchain Commons_ had notified _Developer_ promptly.

# General Contract Terms

## Governing Law

Wyoming law will govern all rights and duties under this agreement.

## No CISG

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this agreement.

## No UCITA

As far as the law allows, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to this agreement.

## Whole Agreement

Both sides intend the _Work Order_ and these terms as the final, complete, and only expression of their terms about _Developer_'s work under the _Work Order_.  However, these terms do not replace or invalidate any nondisclosure agreement.

## Assignment

_Developer_ cannot assign any right under this agreement without _Blockchain Commons_' prior, written, permission. _Blockchain Commons_ can assign this agreement, as a whole, to another business entity that acquires its stock or substantially all its assets, or to a new business entity set up to change its legal form or jurisdiction. Any attempt to assign rights under this agreement against its terms has no legal effect.

## Delegation

Neither side can delegate any duty under this agreement. Any attempt to delegate has no legal effect.

## Unenforceable Terms

If a court decides that any part of this agreement cannot be enforced, for any reason, the rest of this agreement will continue to apply.

## Enforcement

Only _Developer_ and _Blockchain Commons_ can enforce this agreement.

## Lawsuits

**Lawsuits** means any legal actions or claims related to this agreement, ignoring the historical distinction between actions "in law" and "in equity".

## Courts

Both sides agree to bring all _Lawsuits_ related to this agreement only in the federal or state courts in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Both sides consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts, and waive any objection to hearing _Lawsuits_ there.  Both sides can enforce judgments from those courts in other jurisdictions.

## English Rule

Each side agrees to pay the other side's attorney fees and costs if they lose in court.
