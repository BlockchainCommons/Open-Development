# Overview

This document spells out terms under which _Developer_ will develop open software for _Blockchain Commons_.

# Work Order

These terms apply to work done under any **Work Order** that references these terms.  Each _Work Order_, together with these terms, makes up an agreement between _Blockchain Commons_ and _Developer_.

# Developer's Obligations

## Send a W-9

Before beginning any work, _Developer_ agrees to send _Blockchain Commons_ a complete United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8BEN.

## Do the Work

Beginning on receipt of first payment, _Developer_ agrees to complete all milestones on the _Work Order_ in a timely and professional manner by contributing source code and other written work to the repositories on the _Work Order_.  Work will only count as **Contributions** under this agreement when they are:

- stored in Git commits

- signed according to [Sign Every Commit](#sign-every-commit)

- either:

  - pushed to the main development branch of the relevant repository

  - submitted to that repository as pull requests, e-mail-formatted patches, or similar invitations to incorporate into the main development branch

## Stick to the Repositories

_Developer_ agrees to work on the repositories on the _Work Order_ only, and not to count hours working on any other projects or repositories without prior, written approval from _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative.

## Sign Every Commit

_Developer_ agrees to sign Git commits for all _Contributions_ with a single keypair so that each commit can be verified using Git's built-in verify-commit subcommand.

## Leave Time for Approval

_Developer_ agrees to coordinate with _Blockchain Commons_ to ensure that work is delivered with sufficient time left for _Blockchain Commons_ to clarify and approve completion of milestones before the end date on the _Work Order_.  _Developer_ agrees to work on milestones in a logical order that enables _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative to review and approve milestones in sequence, one at a time.

## Spend Spare Hours on the Repositories

If _Developer_ completes all milestones with hours to spare, _Developer_ agrees to use remaining hours to make general or other improvements to the repositories on the _Work Order_.

## Track Time

_Developer_ agrees to track time spent working on milestones in fairly rounded, quarter-hour increments.

## Send Bills

_Developer_ agrees to bill _Blockchain Commons_ for each payment due under the agreement according to _Blockchain Commons_' billing instructions on the _Work Order_.

## Cover General Expenses

_Developer_ agrees to pay for all equipment, licenses, and services needed to develop open software, generally. For example, _Developer_ agrees to provide their own computer, operating system, development environment, and Internet access.

## Return Loaned Equipment

After work is done under the agreement, and at any time on _Blockchain Commons_' request, _Developer_ agrees to promptly return any equipment _Blockchain Commons_ loaned for work under this agreement.

## Manage Subcontractors

If the _Work Order_ allows _Developer_ to use subcontractors:

- _Developer_ agrees to use only subcontractors that have all the expertise needed to do the work efficiently.

- If _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative objects to a particular subcontractor, _Developer_ agrees to stop using that subcontractor to do work under the agreement.

- _Developer_ agrees to sign a contract with each subcontractor requiring them to abide by the terms of this agreement, assign _Intellectual Property Rights_ to _Developer_, and to abide by any nondisclosure agreement between _Developer_ and _Blockchain Commons_.

- _Developer_ agrees to send _Blockchain Commons_ a copy of any contract with a subcontractor promptly on request.

## Appoint Replacement Technical Representatives

_Developer_ agrees to appoint a replacement technical representative, preapproved by _Blockchain Commons_, if the current one leaves or becomes unavailable.

# Blockchain Commons' Obligations

## Pay Developer's Fee

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay _Developer_ the fee on the _Work Order_ on this schedule:

- one third of the fee on entering into this agreement

- one third of the fee after _Developer_'s first weekly report that _Developer_ has worked half the hours on the _Work Order_

- one third of the fee  after all milestones are met

## Follow Payment Instructions

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to make all payments to _Developer_ under this agreement denominated in the currency and according to the payment instructions agreed on the _Work Order_.  _Blockchain Commons_ will not increase or decrease payments under this agreement according to, or to offset, changes in the market price of the denominating currency.

## Pay on Time

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay all correctly billed amounts on each bill within seven calendar days of receipt.  If _Blockchain Commons_ does not pay a bill on time, _Developer_ can notify _Blockchain Commons_ and stop work until all overdue bills are paid.  Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines for as long as work stops.

## Cover Extraordinary Expenses

If milestones require extraordinary equipment, licenses, services or other major expenses, then _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to cover the costs to the _Developer_ that _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative preapproves in writing. For example, _Blockchain Commons_ may approve the costs of proprietary software licenses, testing hardware, and specific online services that milestones requires _Developer_ to use. If _Blockchain Commons_ requires _Developer_ to use and return specific equipment, _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to pay the costs of packaging and shipping, both ways. If _Blockchain Commons_ cannot pay an approved extraordinary expense directly, _Blockchain Commons_ agrees to advance _Developer_ the cost.

## Clarify Milestones

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to respond promptly to _Developer_ requests to clarify milestones.

## Approve Milestones

_Blockchain Commons_ agrees to respond promptly to _Developer_ requests to review _Developer_'s work and either confirm that milestones have been completed or clarify what work still needs to be done.

# Intellectual Property

## Purposes of Intellectual Property Terms

[Intellectual Property](#intellectual-property) assigns ownership of intellectual property in _Developer_'s _Contributions_.  That way:

- _Blockchain Commons_ can choose the license for the work, and update that license over time.

- _Blockchain Commons_ can enforce the terms of the licenses it chooses.

- _Blockchain Commons_ can be sure that it actually has the legal rights needed to license and enforce.

## Intellectual Property Definitions

- **New Intellectual Property** means all _Intellectual Property Rights_ in _Developer's_ _Contributions_.

- **Intellectual Property Rights** means copyrights, mask work rights, moral rights, patent rights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress rights, database rights, and rights in any registrations or applications for _Intellectual Property Rights_.

- **Dependencies** means all works that _Developer_'s _Contributions_ explicitly incorporate, depend on, install, configure, invoke, or link to, directly or indirectly.

## Dependencies

_Developer_ agrees to ensure their _Contriubtions_ under this agreement have only the following kinds of _Dependencies_:

- _Dependencies_ that _Developer_ has the legal right to assign to _Blockchain Commons_ under [Developer Assigns Intellectual Property](#developer-assigns-intellectual-property)

- Permissively licensed software made available to the public on the terms of form licenses that Blue Oak Council rated "Bronze" or better on the start date on the _Work Order_

- _Dependencies_ that _Blockchain Commons_' technical representative specifically preapproves in writing, by name and version, for a specific use case

## Determining Dependencies' Licenses

_Developer_ may rely on LICENSE, COPYING, and similar files, as well as other copyright notices, header comments, or standardized software package metadata, to determine whether _Dependencies_ meet the requirements of [Dependencies](#dependencies).

## Developer Assigns Intellectual Property

_Developer_ assigns all _New Intellectual Property_ to _Blockchain Commons_. Among the rights assigned are:

- ownership of _New Intellectual Property_

- all rights to make legal claims for infringement of _New Intellectual Property_

- all rights to seek legal remedies for infringement of _New Intellectual Property_, such as money damages, injunctions, and other "equitable remedies", as well as any other compensation, benefits, or procedural privileges a court might award

- all other rights _Developer_ has in _New Intellectual Property_

## Further Steps

_Developer_ will do everything necessary to paper assignments in [Developer Assigns Intellectual Property](#contractor-assigns-intellectual-property), make them legally effective, and help _Blockchain Commons_ enforce the rights assigned. _Blockchain Commons_ will notify _Developer_ by e-mail of any further steps required, provide all necessary documentation, and reimburse _Developer_ for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

## Blockchain Commons Can Act on Developer's Behalf

### What Blockchain Commons Can Do

_Blockchain Commons_ can take action under [Further Steps](#further-steps) on _Developer_'s behalf if _Blockchain Commons_ can't find _Developer_, if _Developer_ isn't capable of doing so, or if _Developer_ refuses to do so.

### Legal Intent

In legal terms of art, _Blockchain Commons_ and _Developer_ intend [What Blockchain Commons Can Do](#what-blockchain-commons-can-do) to appoint _Blockchain Commons_ as _Developer_'s "attorney in fact with full right of substitution" to act on _Developer_'s behalf under [Further Steps](#further-steps).

## Other Intellectual Property

_Developer_ licenses _Blockchain Commons_ to do everything that would otherwise infringe _Intellectual Property Rights_ that _Developer_ can license, other than _New Intellectual Property_, that _Developer_'s _Contributions_ use or build on. The license continues forever, cannot be revoked, imposes no royalty or other charge, and allows _Blockchain Commons_ to sublicense.

# Working Relationship

## Independence

_Developer_ will decide when, where, and how to work under this agreement, with the discretion of an independent contractor. _Developer_ will not have any power to enter agreements or take other legal action on _Blockchain Commons_' behalf.

## Personnel

If the _Work Order_ allows, _Developer_ can use employee and contractor personnel to do any work under this agreement. Those personnel will be employees and contractors of _Developer_, not _Blockchain Commons_.

## No Benefits

Neither _Developer_ nor any _Developer_ personnel will receive any employee benefits from _Blockchain Commons_.

## Compliance

Both sides will do their respective parts for tax, labor, employment, and immigration law compliance, consistent with their independent-contractor relationship under this agreement.

## Compliance Indemnity

_Developer_ will pay any losses that _Blockchain Commons_ pays or becomes legally responsible to pay, including expenses of defending against any legal claim, related to _Developer_'s failure under [Compliance](#compliance) for _Developer_ or any _Developer_ personnel. _Blockchain Commons_ will promptly notify _Developer_ by e-mail whenever it anticipates possible losses that _Developer_ might have to pay. If _Blockchain Commons_ fails to notify _Developer_ promptly, _Developer_ will not pay _Blockchain Commons_ losses that _Developer_ could have reduced or defended against if _Blockchain Commons_ had notified _Developer_ promptly.
