# Open Development Legal Resources

This repo is a resource where we share our best practices for open development legal contracts, so that they can be used by other companies or individuals. 

> :book: ***What is Open Development?*** Open development is a larger infrastructure that encompasses open-source licenses but does so while laying out a complete methodology for these projects, from their initial conception through their long-term support. It is built on what we see as the intrinsic goal of the open-source model: for a community to create common resources that can be freely used for the good of all. However, open development looks at this goal as part of an ecosystem that goes well beyond the idea of just developing code and releasing it under an open license.

Our open development legal resources includes:

* *Contributor License Agreement.* An agreement ensuring that contributions to a repo are correctly protected.
* *Work Contracts.* Contracts for use with contributing developers or interns or for security services.

If you have improvements for our work, please share them back to us with [PRs](pulls) or [Issues](issues).

> :warning: **WARNING:** We are not lawyers; use these resources at your own risk.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than those covered by the [Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions) or the 
[Gordian User Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions).
### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.
