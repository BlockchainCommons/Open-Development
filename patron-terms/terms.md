**Blockchain Commons** and **Patron** agree:

# Background

- _Blockchain Commons_ is a public benefit corporation supporting blockchain and other decentralized computing infrastructure through cryptographic research, protocol implementations, architecture and code reviews, standardization efforts, and strategic advisory services.

- _Blockchain Commons_ is deeply committed to open software, open standards, and defensive patenting.  All _Blockchain Commons_ projects are released on the Internet under public license terms, like open source and free culture licenses, that provide broad permission, for free, to all.

- Those strong commitments enable _Blockchain Commons_ to marshal rare talent in a variety of fields, from programming to cryptography to user experience design, to contribute at key points of need for its mission.

- _Blockchain Commons_ can coordinate and accomplish this work only thanks to its patrons: companies in blockchain and allied industries that support _Blockchain Commons_' work financially and benefit from that work both tactically and strategically.

- This agreement sets out terms for _Patron_'s patronage of _Blockchain Commons_' work and mission.  That relationship can and will evolve over time, through a variety of specific engagements.  These terms afford the stable foundation for for that relationship.
